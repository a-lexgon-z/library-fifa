            <h1 class="top">FIFA 21</h1>
            <p>FIFA 21 is a football simulation video game published by Electronic Arts as part of the FIFA series. It is the 28th installment in the FIFA series, and was released 9 October 2020 for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles. Enhanced versions for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and Google Stadia were released later.

                EA Play subscribers were able to get a 10 hour trial of FIFA 21 on 1 October 2020.</p>

            <h1 class="middle">ULTIMATE TEAM</h1>
            <p>Ultimate Team features 100 icon players, including 11 new names. Eric Cantona, Petr Čech, Ashley Cole, Samuel Eto'o, Philipp Lahm, Ferenc Puskás, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Davor Šuker, Fernando Torres, Nemanja Vidić, and Xavi all feature as icons for the first time. Jens Lehmann will not be an icon in FUT 21.

                Ultimate Team will see the addition of a co-op gameplay feature in the form of Division Rivals, Squad Battles and Friendlies with a friend online to unlock objectives and rewards. FUT was surrounded by controversy due to it being classified as a "loot box" and a source of online gambling. FIFA points were already banned in Belgium and could be banned worldwide soon. The players can customise their own FUT stadium with tifos, pyrotechnics, trophies, music, statues and stands as their FUT club grows. In-game stats can now be upgraded individually for special cards (the example given is if Trent Alexander-Arnold scored a free-kick for a TOTW in-form item, the free-kick accuracy can be much higher than his other in-form items). Live FUT friendlies combines house rules with squad rules to create different match types that change throughout the year. Redesigned menus allow the access to their squad and stadium directly from anywhere in the main menu. In new FUT events, the players can pick sides and compete against the FUT community to unlock packs, coins, club items or players in Team Event Objectives. The players can work together with the entire community and earn shared rewards by completing objectives as a collective.
                    
                The Top 100 will be expanded to Top 200 in FUT Champions. 30 matches in Division Rivals contribute to their weekly rating. They can play more matches for skill points and FUT Champions points but they won't increase own rank. Players can make extra coin rewards when they get promoted to a new division for the first time in Division Rivals. Squad Battles can be used to determine their rivals division at the start of FUT 21.
                    
                Fitness and training consumable items have been removed from the game. Players will still lose fitness and stamina during a match, but will automatically start their next game at full fitness. Healing items have been simplified to just gold common and rare items.
                    
                The player's club can be transferred from PlayStation 4 to PlayStation 5, and from Xbox One to Xbox Series X and Series S, but not from PlayStation to Xbox or vice versa though.
                    
                On 9 September 2020, EA Released the Ultimate Team ratings of the Top 100 Players. Barcelona forward Lionel Messi topped the list with a rating of 93, followed by Juventus forward Cristiano Ronaldo with a 92 rating, and Atletico Madrid goalkeeper Jan Oblak, Paris Saint-Germain forward Neymar, Manchester City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, and Bayern Munich forward Robert Lewandowski all with 91's. Bruno Fernandes is the best.

    <footer>The game will feature more than 30 official leagues, over 700 clubs, and over 17,000 players. In August 2020, EA Sports announced an exclusive multi-year partnership with AC Milan and Inter Milan.

        Juventus, Roma, River Plate, Boca Juniors, Colo-Colo, Universidad de Chile and Corinthians will not be featured in FIFA 21 and instead are known as Piemonte Calcio, Roma FC, Nuñez, Buenos Aires, CD Viñazur, Deportes Ñuñoa and Oceânico FC respectively. The game will retain the players' likenesses (except for Oceânico FC), but the official badge, kits and stadiums will be unavailable and instead feature custom designs and generic stadiums produced by EA Sports. Bayern Munich is also featured in the game with licenced players and kits but don't have their stadium licence and will play in a generic stadium.
